Major Studio,9,"September 24, 2019","For my first major studio project, I created a scatter plot of sculpture height vs. gender using the Met's artwork tags. Sculptures were first filtered using the keywords ""male"" and ""female"", and then assigned a height value from the Met's full CSV file. To parse the heights, I used a regular expression to match the pattern of height inputs (some were in centimeters, others in inches etc.). This was my first time using D3 and using regular expressions, so although the final result is quite basic, I was really pleased with the outcome. ",ms-scatter.png
Major Studio,10,"October 1, 2019","The qualitative unit focused on ""non-numerical"" information, such as text or images. For this unit I decided to explore the sculpture images further. My initial mockup included a page for each sculpture material category, with information about the main locations of origin for sculptures of the given material, as well as example images of sculptures of varying size. ",ms-qual-sketch2.png
Major Studio,11,"October 15, 2019","My second iteration of the qualitative visualization sketch included a height comparison ""generator"". The idea was to have a slot machine type of game, where users could cycle through to random sculptures of different sized and compare them by relative height. While this was closer to the final layout that I ended up going with, I had to do a lot of tweaking and major editing of the photos before I could actually code this. ",ms-qual-sketch.png
Major Studio,12,"October 29, 2019",The next unit focused on interactivity. Although my first two projecs also included basic user interactivity (tooltip and multiple buttons to simulate a slideshow/carousel) I wanted the interactive unit project to focus much more heavily on additional interactive features that could be layered. Here I created a mockup of clickable bar charts that change based on a range input and display information about a given material when clicked on.,mockup-dark.png
Major Studio,13,"November 5, 2019",This week I created my final interactivity sketches. I kept the range slider features and added more to the beginning of the visualization to help the user navigate the page and understand the interactivity features. ,ms-interactive-mockup.png
Major Studio,14,"November 11, 2019","The final interactive project included this range slider controlled bar chart, created using D3 and the D3-simple-slider library. Users can filter by sculpture height to view the breakdown of sculptures by materials (both count and percentages)",ms-range-bar.png
Major Studio,15,"December 8, 2019","Here I'm showing cumulative work from both the interactive and ""new contexts"" unit. The final height comparison feature ended up including a constant object for comparison based on the height of the tallest selected sculpture. For example, sculptures between 2.5-6 cm are compared to the height of a thumbtack, while sculptures between 25-75 cm are compared to a basketball. ",ms-compare.gif
Major Studio,16,"December 10, 2019",The final project also included a section where users can explore images of all human sculptures filtered by height and sculpture material. I added an interactive magnification hover feature that allows users to inspect the sculptures in more detail using the blowup.js library. ,ms-images.gif
